# Name-Input
Collaborators Benjamin Truckenbrod, Khailil Tookas, Leigh Salvucci
First our program asks for someone's first and last names and a nickname.
Then it inserts their nickname in between their first and last names.

## What it does

This program prints the user's name with their nickname in between their first and last name. It does this by asking for user input.  First it asks for their whole name. Then it asks for their nickname. After the two inputs are supplied, it inserts the nickame in the middle of the two names and prints the combined name.
